# Getting Started with Kumain
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
##Dependencies
- npm
- node.js
##Opening Kumain
Once both CLI's have been installed, do the following:
1. Type `node src/server.js` in order to run the scraping endpoint
2. In a seperate terminal, run `npm start` if you would like to run it locally. If not, the website is publically available at https://papaya-kulfi-4eb72b.netlify.app

##Notes
- The recipes reflects data as it is written on the websites it was scraped on. This includes duplicate recipes and ingredients. Future work includes a linter to filter out ingredients of the same time, and more redundency detection
- Cookbooks work, but require a refresh in order for status to be reflected.
